                                                        Number Guessing Game
The Fun and easy project "Guess the Number" is a short java project that allows the user to 
guess the number generated by the ccomputer and involves the following steps:
  1.The System generates a random number from a given range. say 1 to 100.
  2.The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed dialogue box.
  3.The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is higher/lower than the generated number.
  4.The game continues under the user guessing the number.
You can also incorporate further details as:
  . Limiting the number of attempts
  . Adding more rounds
  . Displaying score
  . Giving points based on the number of attempts.
